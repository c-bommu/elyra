// Trouble with environment setup //

During Weeks 2 & 3, I was having a lot of issues with environment setup. I kept receiving an error with one of the files involved with set-up, which my external mentors presumed did not work with certain environments. Below is the error I was getting, which was in a file called "prettier":

error Command failed with exit code 2.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
make: *** [Makefile:110: prettier-ui] Error 2

I overcame this issue after I met with one of my external mentors outside of class over Webex to keep trying different solutions, and we resorted to creating a new environment for me within a Docker container. Fortunately, this worked. We theorized that installation was not working properly in my environment due to yarn and node not being installed correctly on my system. 
As a result, the first issue I decided to work on aimed to solve the problem I went through during installation.

// First issue //

In my first issue, our objective was to ensure that the contributor can check to see that they have the correct versions of yarn and node installed during the installation process. Unfortunately, I was (and still am) extremely new to Git, so I knew nothing about how to create a new branch, modify a file, or make a commit. I did not know that I could make make commits to my someone else's branch, so I thought only one of us (me, or the person I was working on the issue with) could commit and make a pull request after making changes to the files. As a result, I made the necessary changes to the files but never ended up commiting them. My partner in the issue had more experience than me when it came to Git, so I was struggling to follow along the process of committing and making a pull request since they were going through it so quickly and I kept running into issues (I had not set up an SSH key at the time). My lack of knowledge left me unable to make a commit for this issue. 

As a result, my struggle led to the opening of a new issue: breaking up the contribution guidelines for making a pull request in order to make them easier to follow.

// Second issue //

Before I could start working on my new issue, I had to learn about the process of making a pull request in the first place since I had never made one before. I spent some time looking into resources, specifically a link that one of my external mentors pointed me to.

I still felt unfamiliar with the process, as I still had not actually gone through it. It was at this time that I reached out to Professor Turner, who I explained my circumstances to. He then walked me through the steps of making a commit, during which he helped me set up an SSH key, create a new branch, create this file, and commit it. He also pointed me to another resource to help familiarize myself with Git, which I am currently looking through.

As I understand more of how Git works, I am able to start working on my new issue.
